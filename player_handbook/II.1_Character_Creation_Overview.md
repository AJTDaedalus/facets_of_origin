# Character Creation

## Introduction
 
  Your character is how you interact with the world around you and the rest of your
party.  Your character is a combination of the backstory, personality, and your own
internal vision for the character as well as game statistics that define how the
character interacts with the world around him within the game.

  Both of these aspects are tracked in the Facets Character Sheet, either on paper or
in the virtual interface.  This chapter will walk you through the process for creating
your character and begin their adventure!


## Backstory

  While the rest of this chapter is focused on the game statistics that define how your
character interacts with the world around them, it would be remiss not to mention the
importance of your character's backstory in the process of creating your character.
Whether you're making a character for a single night adventure or a long campaign, it is
important to think about your character's backstory before putting numbers on a sheet.

  There are many factors that affect not only your character's backstory, but also how
detailed you may want to be when defining it.  If you're only using this character for
one night, it doesn't usually make sense to write pages of backstory.  A few short
sentences may well suffice.  For a planned long campaign, you may want a more detailed
backstory that you can share with your DM for them to include in the mythos of the world
they're creating.  

Some example questions to ask about your character before continuing on:
What drove them to choose the life they have?
What makes them want to join the party?
What do they value in life?
What family do they have?
Where are they from?
