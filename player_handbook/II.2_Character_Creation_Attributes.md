# Character Creation: Attributes

## Introduction
 
  Attributes represent your character's capabilities and contribute to almost everything
your character does.  Most actions that require a roll will depend on at least one
attribute.  In this section, We will discuss the attributes, what they mean, and how to
distribute your attribute points for your character.

## Major Attributes

  Major attributes represent the key aspects of your character's capabilities. Major
attributes are used for saving throws.  The modifier for major attributes are not
selected directly, but are the sum of the modifiers for their three minor attributes.
The major attributes are as follows:

Body:  Represents the physical capabilities of your character.
  Body consists of three minor attributes:  Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution

Mind:  Represents the mental capabilities of your character.
  Mind consists of three minor attributes:  Intelligence, Wisdom, and Knowledge

Soul:  Represents the spiritual capabilities of your character.
  Soul consists of three minor attributes:  Spirit, Luck, and Charisma

## Minor Attributes

  Minor attributes represent the minor aspects of your character's capabilities. Most
actions are modified by one of the minor attributes.  Each character gets 18 attribute
points to distribute between the 9 minor attributes.  Each minor attribute can be
allocated between 1-3 points.  Minor attributes with 1, 2, and 3 points are considered
"weak", "average", and "strong", respectively.  The minor attributes and what they
control are listed below:
