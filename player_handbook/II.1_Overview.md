# Character Creation Overview

### Planning Your Character
  The first step for creating your character is coming up with a backstory.  Speak with
your game master about what modules are available, what the theme of the campaign will
be, and for advice on how to build a character.  Feel free to communicate with other
players if you'd like them to know each other, or if you'd like to make sure the party
has a specific balance.
  
  Before creating stats, skills, and other parts of your character sheet, it is important
to think about your characters background.  What events in their life have shaped their
perception of the world around them?  What is their primary motivation?  What do they
believe in, dream about, and spend their money on?  Try to develop a backstory that
differentiates them from others in the party, while also giving them a solid motivator to
work with others as a member of the party.  Share this with your game master so they can
keep it in mind while leading the campaign.

The character sheet provides a "Details" section specifically for this.  Feel free to
fill this out as much or as little as you'd like.  

### Character Creation Flow

After creating your backstory, it's time to build the functional side of your character
sheet.  We'll walk through the steps to prepare your character for interacting with the
world around them!

1.  You will fill out the "Details" section of your character sheet based on the backstory you developed.  This will provide quick reference in the future for RP elements of your character.
2.  You will assign attribute points to determine what your characters strengths and weaknesses are. 
3.  You will select your characters race, class, and background.
4.  You will decide which skills your character is proficient in.
